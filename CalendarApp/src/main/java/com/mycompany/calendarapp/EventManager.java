/**
 * EventManager Class
 * 
 * This class is the central manager for all events in the calendar application.
 * It acts as a container and controller for the event collection.
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * - Store and manage all calendar events (both normal and recurring)
 * - Provide methods to add, find, update, and delete events
 * - Generate unique event IDs
 * - Detect clashing/conflicting events
 * - Expand recurring events into their individual occurrences
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Maintaining the master list of all events
 * - ID generation and management
 * - Event conflict detection
 * - Event retrieval and filtering
